## MCP Series

Collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that enable powerful automation between AI and diverse external services and platforms.

### About

MCP Series is an organization dedicated to developing and maintaining high-quality Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Our mission is to expand the capabilities of LLMs through well-designed integrations that connect language models with external services, applications, and data sources.

#### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework that allows LLMs (Large Language Models) to access external tools and services. MCP servers act as bridges between AI systems and various applications, enabling LLMs to perform actions in the real world that would otherwise be impossible within their standard context window.
