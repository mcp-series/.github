# MCP Series

A comprehensive collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that empower AI assistants with advanced capabilities to interact with external services, platforms, content sources, and real-time data.

## About MCP Series

MCP Series is a professional organization dedicated to developing and maintaining enterprise-grade Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Our mission is to extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through rigorously designed integrations, enabling seamless connections between AI systems and a diverse range of external services, applications, and real-time data sources. We currently maintain a growing ecosystem of four production-ready MCP servers with more integrations in active development.

### What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a sophisticated framework that enables LLMs to access and interact with external tools and services programmatically. MCP servers function as robust bridges between AI systems and various applications, allowing language models to perform concrete actions in the digital world that would otherwise be impossible within their standard context windows.

This protocol empowers AI assistants to:
- Access real-time data sources
- Interact with external APIs and services
- Control and manipulate connected platforms
- Retrieve and process information from specialized domains
- Execute complex operations based on natural language requests

## Getting Started

MCP servers follow a consistent installation and configuration pattern, making deployment straightforward across our entire ecosystem:

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the desired repository
git clone https://github.com/mcp-series/[repository-name]
cd [repository-name]

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build the project (if needed)
npm run build
```

### Configuration

Each MCP server can be configured in the Claude Desktop configuration file:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serverName": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["ABSOLUTE_PATH/[repository-name]/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Detailed installation and configuration instructions are available in each repository's README.

## Usage Examples

Our MCPs are designed for intuitive interaction through natural language:

### Status Observer

```
status --github
status --all
status list
```

Natural language queries:
- "Is GitHub experiencing any outages right now?"
- "Check the status of Cloudflare's network"
- "Are there any issues with Vercel deployments today?"

### Hacker News

```
hn latest --50
hn top --20
hn best --30
hn comments --5
```

Natural language queries:
- "Show me the top 30 stories on Hacker News today"
- "What are the latest tech discussions on Hacker News?"
- "Get me the comments on the third Hacker News story"

### Spotify

```
auth-spotify
search-spotify --query="Coldplay" --type="track" --limit=5
play-track --trackId="spotify:track:123456"
get-recommendations --seedArtists=["artist1"] --limit=10
```

Natural language queries:
- "Find some jazz music on Spotify"
- "Create a playlist of relaxing study music"
- "What's currently playing on my Spotify account?"
