# MCP Series

A comprehensive collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that empower AI assistants with advanced capabilities to interact with external services, platforms, content sources, and real-time data.

## About MCP Series

MCP Series is a professional organization dedicated to developing and maintaining enterprise-grade Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Our mission is to extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through rigorously designed integrations, enabling seamless connections between AI systems and a diverse range of external services, applications, and real-time data sources. We currently maintain a growing ecosystem of eight production-ready MCP servers with more integrations in active development.

### What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. This protocol focuses on production-ready and experimental MCP servers that extend AI capabilities through file access, database connections, API integrations, and other contextual services.
